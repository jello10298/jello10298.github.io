        "longDesc": `There is a kind of magic that really works and is not merely a matter of trickery, sleight of hand, hocus-pocus, or stage illusions. Magic, the "possibility of the impossible," is nothing more than becoming one with yourself, with God, and the world. The number of this card —one— cannot be divided by any other number in tarot. Significantly, the term "indivisible" has the same Latin root as "individual."
        <br />We are all artists and magicians. On this card, Dalí himself poses as a "magus," as THE MAGICIAN, displaying paraphernalia from some of his best-known works on the table. He thus draws attention to himself and yet we realize that each individual is being invited to take part-according to their own individual talents and qualities. 
        <br />On your personal journey, you go through unique experiences and come up with solutions that no one has ever arrived at previously, as if under a wonderful spell. But your personal magic is not really supernatural. It is merely a matter of successfully fashioning your own unique existence by drawing on your special talents and qualities. The flames in the picture symbolize the life force, the fire of creation and transmutation lying dormant in each of us. 
        <br />The bread and wine (on the table) stand for the individuals participation in the divine act of creation. The "soft" clock represents the elasticity and uniqueness of your personal life-time, while the scroll on the table implies that you should take command of your own life by making plans and determining your own role. Like the columns in the composition, all aspects of your personality should complement each other and unite in serving a higher purpose. To this end, it is important to stay open (blue background), to go beyond your current limitations (just as the picture breaks through the upper frame), and to see your work within a larger context (taking into account the upper corners of the image).`,

        "longDesc": `High priestesses are encountered throughout human history and mythology as oracular authorities, exemplified by the Pythia of Delphi, sibyls, or prophetesses like Cassandra. Being a mirror, this card counsels you that it is quite correct and effective to seek guidance first and foremost within yourself.
        <br />Many tarot decks depict THE HIGH PRIESTESS holding a holy book. She is reading the "script" of her own life. Dalí gives her a scroll to hold, expressing the same idea. This card is all about your own role and your personal way of life, personal taste and style, and about expressing your own opinion.
        <br />The predominantly blue hues and the crescent moon symbolize the power of your soul, your inner voice, and your moods - as changeable as the phases of the moon - which decide your success in life.
        <br />It is interesting how Dalí depicts the clothing of the HIGH PRIESTESS. The outer garment (a king of cloak) is reminiscent of a nun's habit as found in many portrayals of the Mother Mary.  But underneath her cloak, the figure wears a black and blue sequined evening gown, imparting a mundane and feline look. Like the cat statue in the left foreground, the big head at the left margin - the "child's head" - represents the unconscious, libidinous mind feeding and tempting the soul with its long tongue.
        <br />In sum, THE HIGH PRIESTESS encourages you to develop the power of your own soul and your own inner perceptions in order to mediate between piety and frivolity, nun-like devotion and cat-like instincts. The script of your life should be unrolled and evolved.`,

        <br />The card is a mirror of your own femininity (or of the female qualities in a man), reflecting your personal experiences as a woman and/or with other women, the heritage of your mother, your grandmothers, and your foremothers.
        <br />THE EMPRESS has the face of Gala Dalí. Much has been written about the degree to which Gala dominated Dalí. But this card goes way beyond any biographical anecdotes. The expansive, open-ended background locates the central figure-taken from a picture by Delacroix-within a vast realm in front of a sea of possibilities. The imperial orb in her left hand symbolizes fertility as well as the globe, and thus represents the challenge to claim this vast land for oneself and to take command of it. The lily scepter in her right hand is an early symbol of fertility and virility. White stars dancing around the head of the figure elevate her above the blue water and the grayish mountains. This card is all about living a fruitful, flourishing, and star-studded life. Women as well as men are encouraged to become rulers of their own destiny and to take responsibility for their own well-being and fortune.`,

        "longDesc": `Emperors and kings, Zeus and Jupiter, and many other father figures have informed this image. It is a mirror of your own masculinity (or of the male qualities in a woman), reflecting your personal experiences as a man and/or with other men, the heritage of your father, your grandfathers, and your forefathers. This card is not only a symbol of external (family or public) order, but also of your ability to take charge of your own destiny.
        <br />The message of THE EMPEROR should be heeded by both men and women, encouraging the art of self-rule and self-motivation. The lily scepter in the left hand of the figure is a symbol of might and virility, of the life force and fertility. Yet the color-ful figure in the foreground, in all its magnificence and vitality, is presented in sharp contrast to the pale desert and dark ruins in the background. The meaning? Our greatest talents will come to nothing, if they are used destructively or if we don't succeed in creating something new out of dereliction. The wasteland must be turned into a garden! Every one of us brings something original into the world, which is waiting to be explored and developed. THE EMPEROR represents the pioneering spirit in us all and the ability to open up new possibilities in life or love.
        <br />Dalí shares this interpretation with many other depictions of THE EMPEROR. What is different is the remarkable and unique position of the right hand. This gesture can evoke indecisiveness, or weakness. But by the same token, it may suggest a teasing and coquettish, even camp playfulness. The impact is underscored by the two little birds (symbols of spirit, Eros, will-power, and imagination).`,

        <br />The staff with the triple cross points to the Christian pope. In a much broader sense, it is a symbol of a bond, of the interconnections between heaven and earth. 'The staff is like an an-tenna, which enables you to receive messages from near and far and transmit others.
        <br />The challenge is addressed to the whole person. The difference in scale of the various figures is a metaphor for personal strengths and weaknesses. Both should be utilized, stretching out beyond existing boundaries. The circles and rays around the figures head symbolize a higher consciousness, which transcends individual personality. For religious-minded people, this card refers to finding one's way to God and making peace with Him. In a broader sense, this card is all about teaching and learning, initiation and understanding. In order to know others, we have to know ourselves and thus become able to appreciate the purpose of our own existence.
        <br />What is so special about Dalí's interpretation is that it focuses on the mutual initiation and communication processes between people (or between different aspects of the personality). Aside from the three figures, there is no church and no hint of religious dogma to be seen. But the halo around the head expands the dimensions at issue. Dalí shows that the sacred manifests itself in our daily human interaction. Each person can be a spiritual teacher for every other person.`,

        <br />We long for love, but we may also be afraid to love and/or to be loved. Whether or not love makes us happy depends greatly on what hopes and expectations we hold about "love." As long as you are looking for your "better half," you risk being only half a person. Or we may be looking for someone who is most like ourselves. Ask yourself if this is what you are seeking. For if you are looking for the one who resembles you in every respect, who knows and understands you intimately, that person can only be yourself.
        <br />The more pronounced the distinctions, the more precious the points of harmony. Once you have learned to love the differences, the doors to a new paradise will open. However, many shadows and dark clouds will create obstacles on your path.

Everything you do on the way is worth your while, even if it requires a lot of effort or (apparent) detours. And even the greatest achievements mean nothing if they do not help you on your way of desire—as wisely coined in the phrase "the journey is its own reward."

        <br />The land on the card represents familiar territory, and the water, the uncharted territories beyond. In order to judge wisely, you have to connect the known with the unknown— and learn to distinguish one from the other. The scales of justice measure what is only vaguely known. Unclear feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations have to be evaluated, prejudices have to be overcome.
        <br />Dalí adapted the woman from one of Lucas Cranach the Elder's famous paintings. Her wild mane represents an abundance of life force, but also the invincible spirit of JUSTICE. Her maidenly body encourages a reappraisal of virginity (a theme already addressed by the card THE HERMIT). Some people consider virginity and innocence to be lost forever with the first sexual encounter: Others regard these virtues as being goals of personal growth that we have to work towards. "Innocence is not something that can be lost, it is something to be gained" (Bertolt Brecht). This kind of virginity and innocence is exemplified by mindfulness and the ability to get involved while avoiding entanglements and overidentification.`,

        <br />This card is all about evaluating the sum of your experiences and constantly reorganizing your life accordingly. Every human being brings something original and novel into the world, represented by the embryo in the lantern, the homunculus. Above the head of the figure, we see jewels, some of them egg-shaped. Like the embryo, the egg is a symbol of fertility and of the growth of something new.
        <br />Your light gets stronger as you resolve your own contradictions. If you do not assume responsibility for your life or if you retreat into incompetence or irresponsibility, you will fail to approach the magnificent power of the HERMIT.

In 1494 he wrote his epochal work Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita, a summary of the entire mathematical knowledge of the time. One of the chapters made him especially famous, because it was the first comprehensive treatise on double-entry accounting. In Milan, he taught Leonardo da Vinci perspective and proportionality.

Outside the circle, five figures can be seen based on well-known depictions of the four evangelists and also representing the four elements earth, fire, air, and water. On top of the wheel, there is an Oriental man holding a scimitar. The disc in the middle is divided into two parts, indicating human consciousness and the unconscious mind. Both parts of the image complement each other, but differences are also apparent. The lower section is full of symbols and signs, while the upper areas are empty. This might suggest that the messages of the unconscious are conveyed through symbols alone.
        <br />The Greek word "symbol" in a general sense means, "that which has been thrown together," an appropriate concept for this card.

His essence is suspended in the heavenly; the transcendental, in a manner reminiscent of religious images. At the same time, the picture could be interpreted as an underwater world, a land of dreams, or an otherworld, in which THE HANGED MAN is immersed.
        <br />Saint Francis's motto was "Metanoeite," which can be translated as "Turn around and change." His symbol is St. Anthony's Cross. Saul turned into Paul.

The image is more like a sketch then a finished painting and it also seems to be less artful than the others. All these features have given rise to considerable speculation. Rachel Pollack has called the picture a "crude comic"; others consider it to be a rather awkward homage to Dalt's lady friend Amanda Lear, while still others simply suspect that Dalt didn't know what to do with a card called TEMPERANCE.
        <br />In the upper left corner, we can see some letters painted over in blue, but these also fail to explain the true meaning of the card. Either it is just a blunder, a changeling among the 78 cards, or its meaning lies in a different realm altogether. Even in ancient Greece, long before the first tarot cards were created, temperance was considered to be one of the cardinal virtues. It has to do with the right measure of all things and with basic human creativity.
        <br />We will not find our own true measure, our art, and our own style of living by looking up to idols and masters. What seems to be a foundling among Dal's tarot cards is really a provocation: the card urges us to become active as an artist and a master of the art of life in designing our own lives.
        <br />Traditionally, TEMPERANCE is considered to be a fire card. Purification through fire sloughs off all dross, allowing true will to be reborn. This can only be recovered by giving up the position of commentator and spectator and becoming an active participant in life.`,
        "source": `Original work by Salvador Dalí for his tarot, putatively authored by Amanda Lear. In 1965, Dalí met Alain Tapp, who would later become a famous singer under the name Amanda Lear. Dalí was fascinated by what he called the "confusion of the sexes." Soon, Amanda had become part of Dalí's entourage. Although initially Gala could hardly tolerate her, Amanda became Dalí's most important female friend. Gala gradually changed her mind and, in the end, she wanted Amanda to take care of Dalí after her death. Amanda was the model for Dalís painting Roger Rescuing Angelica (ca. 1970).`,

        "longDesc": `The card depicts a hermaphrodite figure with a wild mane, a horned head, and a further horn on one knee, holding a wand or a flute in its hand and bouncing off some kind of pedestal. Two black arms release the figure or try to grab at it. This card appears strange at first glance, but it cleverly avoids a stereotypical portrayal of the Devil. So we are able to ask, "What meaning does the Devil have for us today?" Each and every human being brings something new into the world, but we all have certain qualities and peculiarities that do not fit into the present framework. Every human being continues the story of creation —and therefore is bound eventually to enter the realm of taboo.
        <br />THE DEVIL card clearly indicates that some kind of taboo has been violated. What was implicit now becomes visible. This can be used to your advantage because you can now take on the task of openly dealing with taboos, affirming meaningful ones, and getting rid of others that are senseless.
        <br />Don't be put off by the bully. This is your chance to break some old horns. On the one hand, THE DEVIL represents a vampire and a real burden and vexation. No wonder we are afraid. Yet this is our opportunity to rid ourselves of the darkness that we have finally recognized for what it is. On the other hand, THE DEVIL represents the "prodigal son," that part of us that we have always tended to deny and neglect although we secretly and rightfully long for it. Now is the time to bring the prodigal son home.`,

The building of the Tower of Babel is a symbol of human megalomania, culminating not only in the destruction of the tower but also in the Babylonian confusion of tongues. Pentecost is the opposite of the building of the tower. The Holy Ghost descends upon the disciples in the form of a storm and tongues of fire. As they start to talk, everyone hears themselves speaking in their own language. Instead of a confusion of tongues, this event symbolizes the tearing down of all language barriers.
        <br />Babel and Pentecost are two opposite poles. Violence destroys and results in speechlessness and confusion. In contrast, love tears down all language barriers and makes true communication possible without limits.
        <br />The card cautions you to beware of megalomania and lack of steadfastness. There might be rocky times ahead.

Once the star lightens up your day as well as your night, then the truth will be revealed in all its beauty.
        <br />Sometimes, the card warns you of inappropriate brazenness or compromise. The great blue serpent in the sky represents the wonders of creation that you yourself experience.

Be equally careful not to neglect your own light by becoming mesmerized by other distant stars.

Yet the card is rendered in darker tones: most versions of this card depict twins, mostly shown as children, which discreetly hints at the second birth! The second birth is a metaphor, which means that you as an adult have to be reborn, and moreover give birth to yourself this time around. Your first birth brought you into this world. Your "second birth" is nothing less than deliberately choosing your own life's path, no longer restricted by habitual behavior and fixed routines but informed by free choice and by exercising your own free will. Traditional behavior and thought patterns are replaced by a consciously chosen lifestyle. The "second birth" may be followed by a third, a fourth birth, and more, in a progressive path of renewal. But the "second birth" is decisive, as the first one to be undertaken deliberately.
        <br />This theme is common to the Buddhist goal of enlightenment or the Christian maxim "If you do not become like the little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
        <br />This second birth is possible only as the result of a process of becoming.

In the foreground, we see an open shell sketched in black ink, revealing its pearl. This detail represents the message of the card.
        <br />Powerful forces are being set in motion; latent energies are being awakened. Processes of change and transformation are immanent. This card challenges you to take a closer look at and come to terms with those extreme aspects of your life. Desires and fears, as well as the habit of putting the blame on yourself and others, will have to be dealt with over and again, until the mistakes of your past have been put to rights and your future path freed from old obstacles. Only then will rebirth be more than a mere repetition of the old.
        <br />The story of Judgment Day is not just a religious myth: it is to be taken literally. The Day of Judgment is today! Each and every morning we are faced with the task of becoming wide awake and gathering all of our energy, so that we can really bury all that is dead and gone and prepare ourselves for the birth of what is yet to come.
        <br />If we can accept every single day as a gift, we will gain in confidence and be able to welcome life's challenges.

Humanity has not just descended from heaven to earth like angels, but is also a product of a long evolution. On every level of our development as humans, we are called upon to deal with our heritage.

Like the initial point of a coordinate system, this card represents the beginning of everything that makes up an individual.
        <br />To look into the future with courage implies charting your own course, not least when all role models have failed you and you are forced to act into the blue without any prior support. The more unusual your path, the more panic you will experience if you have to go down it. Pan in Greek means "all." Therefore, panic means "all-at-once." The more room you give THE FOOL in your life, the easier it will be to get used to accepting yourself, God, and the world as they are, as the supplicant saint in the picture demonstrates. In this way, everything you know takes on a special importance in your life— when the time is right.

This is especially true of the figure depicted on this card, which portrays the French queen Marie Antoinette from a painting by Marie Louise Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.
        <br />If you draw this card, not just the mastery of a single aspect of your will and vigor is being addressed but your confident handling of all forces of fire, your mastery as an energetic being. Many versions of this card show a cat, but here, a tail-wagging dog leaps towards the queen. Play, movement, and hunting instinct are just as important for this queen as living in and with nature, as signified by the tree and the sketchily drawn birds sitting on its branches.
        <br />It is important to note that the tree and the dog are located outside the queen's frame of reference. The success of your actions is critically dependent upon recognizing the existence of subliminal and unconscious, mainly vegetative processes. Instinctive drives, energetic action, and will, the forces af growth represented by the wands, are of utmost importance to this end.

        <br />The meaning of this symbol is not quite as innocent as one might suppose. As an adult, you have to become a child again in order to confidently handle the fire within you (instinctive drives, actions, and will). The giant wand represents a phallus as well as a witch's broom. It is a symbol of motivation, growth, and vitality as well as of power and the strength to succeed.
        <br />Underneath the throne, we see a small animal, which could be an ermine or a stoat. It warns you to beware of nagging doubts, intrigues, and beastliness, but also represents the ability to grit your teeth and carry on, purposefully, perhaps putting aggression to good use, in order to reach your goal. The fur of the ermine can also indicate royal dignity.
        <br />As in many other tarot decks, the back of the throne is emphasized, rising up like a mighty red flame surrounded by a blue silhouette. This apparition conveys an air of coolness or stiffness in its shadowy face, seen in profile. The visage looks amused as well as stern. As a child, we are usually uninhibited. But once we grow up, we lose contact with the world of the child and are often haunted by nagging doubts. Or we refuse to grow up and are suddenly and unexpectedly shocked by the power within us, for good and ill.`,

All these symbols have one common denominator: "Become who you are!" For this is the card of your life's mission. When we start out on our journey, we are small, just like the horse and rider, more an outline than a finished picture. The details have to be augmented and colored in. Our aim in life and our potential is self-realization and the full development of our personality. The violet-red lines delineate this huge task. The gigantic wand hints at strong drives and a sustainable energy supply.
        <br />Our life's tasks are the greatest and best that we will ever encounter. They require and focus all our strength; their completion lasts a lifetime. Often on this journey, high ideals and toad-like instincts have to be overcome. If you possess a lot of fire, you are not only very courageous, but often also extremely tired, retiring, or irritable. "Once burned, twice shy." The blue ornate toad functions as a point of reference in two ways: the knight appears to flee from it and yet the creature also exerts an attractive force.`,

At the same time, the card counsels us to be aware of the limitations of our perceptions, because we are absorbed in our own world. The snake-like or butterfly-like drawings around the central figure alert us to our much greater potential. Our zest for action and desire to develop urge us on to reach beyond our own boundaries now.
        <br />In relation to our motivational forces (wands, fire, energy) the scope of our actual experience is relatively small. This is a danger, but also an opportunity. Beware of naive inactivity as well as effusive zeal. We once entered this life full of the will to survive, to grow, and to express ourselves. We can harness this zeal now to explore the world thoroughly, greeting each success or failure as a new experience.

It is possible to overcome even the greatest of difficulties. Turn emotional conflicts into practical tasks and find the solution that fits the problem.
        <br />This solution always has to do with an alchemical transformation of the coarse into the subtle. Break up the seemingly insurmountable problem into smaller portions that are easier to deal with. This approach is much more useful than "staring the snake in the eye" (note the green something at the foot of the figure) and much better than false compromises.
        <br />It is necessary to have a model and a vision of the chosen objective-like the miniature castle with swans depicted on the silver platter or mirror that the woman is carrying. It may be necessary to go through the fires of hell to achieve these goals. The bird on the right could be a cock, the symbol of alertness and of pride. With a little imagination, a phoenix can be identified, the bird of fire, the legendary bird that has to burn up periodically to be reborn from the ashes and regain its beauty.

The female silhouette does not represent any particular woman, but women in general, the mother archetype, or the feminine principle. Many philosophers have described the ocean as the "eternally feminine," the source and aim of all our striving. The female silhouette and the ship hint at opposing desires: the longing for closeness and the desire for remoteness, for home and abroad, arrival and departure.
        <br />This requires a lot of practical experience and individual metamorphoses. Personal advances (represented by the butterflies) unite instincts and actions (symbolized by wands and ship) patiently and serenely (the shadowy woman and the ocean), in such a way that one does not take precedence over the other. What's so special about this image is the way that the woman and the ship are connected. Even the greatest of undertakings are based on aspects close to hand, namely in personal relationships. It is contact with others that gives us the energy and the fuel to go forth into the farthest corners of the earth.`,

In many cultural traditions, a blue flower represents the mysteries of life and the wonders of creation.
        <br />The term "wonders of creation" pertains to our most intimate, our most difficult, and most beautiful experiences. Birth, marriage, and death (which may be represented by the three figures) always take us to the very limits of our understanding. Through being confronted with these sometimes frightening, sometimes wonderful, but always amazing limits to our comprehension, we develop a hunger for culture, a yearning to express that which really moves us through play, music, and dance!

        <br />As long as the fire of life burns, your will Is constantly being reshaped. In the background, seven or eight helmets of lance-bearers and twelve lances can be seen on the card. Each one of the twelve lances and of the five green wands represents a certain type of energy. As if participating in a huge game of pick-up sticks, it is your task to gather up this energy, to sort through it, and to focus it on something worthwhile.
        <br />Different interests and tendencies are always pulling in different directions. What has first priority? How can several goals be attained at the same time?
        <br />An integral part of this process of shaping the will is for existing role models to become obsolete. The red area in the middle of the card stands for your personal fire, your power and vivacity, creating new facts that go way beyond traditional experiences, thus dismissing those redundant conceptions.
        <br />Do not spread your energies too thin. Center yourself. See your current tasks as tests of your determination, your willpower-and your playfulness. Find out which aspects of your will are in harmony with your desires and so able to get something moving.

        <br />On the left, we see a small, faceless figure. It represents mans proverbial inner child. We may rightfully assume that this aspect of the rider is underdeveloped as the figure is drawn so sketchily and with no face. As long as the rider fails to accept his inner child, and as long as he exploits only a fraction of the powers at his disposal (only one of six wands), he will be driven by childish motives and fears- without even being aware of it.
        <br />We often assume that we have to suppress our weaknesses in order to become proud and strong. The picture shows us that in reality, the opposite is true. If you acknowledge strengths as well as weaknesses, you will become much stronger. (See the horse and the energy of the five additional wands.) The five wands represent influences and events that are beyond your control. If you know your strengths and your weaknesses, you will become much more flexible. Thus you enhance your ability to cooperate with your destiny.
        <br />You need to reconcile yourself with your inner child and with your own animalistic aspects. You must make peace with your own imperfections and say good-bye to many immature habits. This process of growing up is represented by the ring and the single wand, which symbolize the differences between as well as the unification of the feminine and the masculine. A mature sexuality makes demands on your personal power and enhances it, vitalizing your self-confidence. It is important to recognize the feminine and the masculine as two aspects of your own personality.`,

Articulated at an angle against this background, seven wands and four arms and hands can be seen.
        <br />Hands and arms symbolize what and how we appreciate and handle things. This card indicates openness and reserve, the palms of our hands as well as the outside, and similarly of our actions. Our handicaps (that word hand again) can be identified in the image as the hand with the protuberance and the fingerless hand (the first and second hands from the top). When arms and wands lie across our life's journey, they indicate that we do not have to accept what is being handed to us. We are being encouraged to march to the sound of our own tune, and shine our own light. Yet we are warned not to put up any unnecessary resistance towards life.
        <br />The thin blue figure on the right shows that we all possess roots that reach deep into the earth (see the spiral at the foot of the blue figure). We possess tools that enable us to reach for the stars (see the crutch or pincers that elongate the right hand of the figure).
        <br />We are always on an evolutionary journey. We constantly learn to deal with complex tasks and handle our energies.

        <br />Dalí's version of this card is unusual as it shows a scene from The Oath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David. The Horatii secured the power of Rome around 660 BC by using subterfuge in a struggle against the Curiatii. Oath and treason, ideals and idols become topical whenever we encounter strong powers and have to learn to face them. Dalí rightfully puts the power of enthusiasm at the center of his picture.
        <br />The book in front of the two wands emphasizes the moving power of the human spirit and of the written word! Great undertakings require motivation and enthusiasm. The right word at the right time can work miracles and heal wounds. But false ideals can also make the blood boil. They open up old wounds and create new ones by being overly zealous or by exercising blind obedience. The insect on the left shows that this all happens on a subconscious, vegetative, or automatic level.

Like a hunter stalking his prey or a scout exploring the way, you need to be intuitively alert and vigilant. Naturally, this card is not about the actual hunter or scout as a profession, it is a symbol of heightened awareness as a personal way of being.
        <br />If your perception has been heightened, you will be better able to understand the motives and hidden interests behind certain actions. Thus you will be able to discover the "green man" in the woods. This figure appears in many traditions. He symbolizes nature around us and within. Dalí depicts his green man with frogs feet, thus making him an amphibious creature living between water and earth. He reaches out to the stalking hunter.
        <br />On the one hand, this card shows us the final goal of all our searching. Intuition and awareness are the path as well as the destination, the journey as well as the reward. Sometimes, we get last in routine and repetition. We fail to perceive the great mystery that is awaiting us.
        <br />On the other hand, this card encourages us to say good-bye to the uncivilized life of a semi-barbarian. Intuition and awareness serve to overcome certain primal fears. Let go of redundant instincts and presumptions. Trust your actual perceptions and learn from all your experiences.`,

        <br />But the card can also be interpreted in a totally different way. Dalí, who often made fun of the Catholic Church, demonstrates in this picture the positive meaning of the Christian symbol of the cross. The burdened figure at the center represents Jesus, who carries the cross and the ten wands on his shoulder all at the same time.
        <br />To carry ten wands means to accept all available energies, all instincts, purposes, and motives. To make a bundle of the ten wands means nothing less than to accept life with all its energies and tasks unconditionally and in its totality. This is also the true meaning of the cross. The cross as a symbol is much older than Christianity. Like the circle or the square, it stands for the division and integration of all forces (for example, the four points of the compass). The Christian maxim "Those who love Jesus should take up his cross and follow him" has the positive meaning of accepting life unconditionally and committing oneself wholeheartedly.
        <br />Dalí shows this absolute devotion to life in a remarkable manner. The butterflies symbolize transformational power, and viewed this way, the face represents a clear conscience and the vision of a meaningful purpose in life.`,

In the upper right corner, we see a little heart or a rose, which symbolizes the shadow as well as the product of exuberant imagination - similar to the phantom shown in the PAGE OF CUPs. What at first glance appear to be dishevelled hair and two crutches become arteries and veins on closer inspection. The central figure represents the heart itself, which is being nourished by the great blood vessels and from which all smaller arteries emerge.
        <br />The QUEEN OF CUPs is really a queen of shells. Her head is graced with a crown that boasts a peak reminiscent of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. In this card, Dalí has used elements of at least tio famous paintings. The central figure was taken from the painting of Elizabeth of Austria by François Clouet whereas her thin moustache was inspired by Marcel Duchamp's well-known persiflage of the Mona Lisa. With his unique composition, Dalí underscored the intended double entendre.
        <br />Many-even modern-interpretations accept only one aspect of the QUEEN OF CUPS and reject the other. Some praise her sensitivity, her emotional and psychic abilities, while others are critical of her reserve, toughness, and introspection. In fact, all these attributes are equally fitting. It is our task to find the common denominator in all these conflicting emotions and eschew one-sided perspectives. Openness and coherence, softness and hardness, female and male qualities are the poles that make for an intact inner life. The result will be spiritual autonomy and personal independence.`,

        <br />The glass symbolizes a test tube or an amniotic sac. On the one hand, it is a positive symbol of transformation, like the alchemistic crucible, and of growing life, like the womb. On the other hand, it is a negative symbol reminding us of unpredictably dangerous scientific experiments. The glass vessel also stands for an invisible wall and shield such as a negative spell or a curse. If this king doesn't want to become a prisoner of his own needs and emotions, he will have to learn to successfully deal with the highest emotional heights as well as the pits. This lesson is symbolized by the lily scepter (see THE EMPRESS and THE EMPEROR) while the wand in his right hand, with a fist or Devil's head at the end, indicates a person with focused energy who is not afraid of any taboos (devils) and who walks his path with a clear conscience and free of sin (lily).
        <br />Instincts and presentiments, temptations and often confusing needs have to be dealt with firmly. The fulfillment of your dominant desires and the dissolution of basic fears will lead to personal maturity and to the surmounting of all vain longing-leading to a blessed state of perfect contentment.

Appropriate beliefs, in contrast, are supportive, inspirational, and uplifting, helping us overcome any difficulties.
        <br />Dalí uses the 1800-01 painting by Jacques-Louis David of Napoleon charging to exemplify human willpower and passion. A (female) head with a very pronounced chin observes the horseman. This indicates that the KNIGHT OF CUPS is enveloped, fulfilled, or imprisoned by the lady (or more generally, person) of his heart.
        <br />The whole spectrum of passion, ranging from courtly love to frenzied infatuation, from loving devotion to woeful obsession, is contained within this card. The difference in scale of the small horseman in relation to the big female head hints at oedipal bonding (a mother complex). Or it might indicate the direction of evolution-from small to big, from internal drive to the external aim to grow and develop.

        <br />If your own emotional state and that of others is not clear, this card counsels you to be cautious.

This image hints that the cup as a symbol is rather ambiguous concerning fullness as well as emptiness, good emotions as well as bad, exalted as well as pompous (arrogant) modes of your psyche.
        <br />Another contradiction of this card is the contrast between the vastness of the sea and the limited capacity of a single cup. Oceanic feelings enable us to experience connectedness with all. The single cup stands for the individuals inner life, the soul. Here, our place in the community is as important as our distinctiveness as an individual. If we manage to attain harmony of the individuality within the great flow of life, we will experience a very special baptism and drink deep from the fountain of youth. The secret of the ACE OF CUPS lies in purification of the psyche. If you can learn to delve deep into your feelings-through reconciliation or by letting go—thus ensuring that no bad feelings or compromises dull the clear mirror of your soul, you will stay young, regardless of your age.

        <br />That love can indeed give wings to the lovers is symbolized by the yellow caduceus of Hermes (two intertwined serpents) and the winged lion's head. The caduceus and winged lion were inspired by the TWO OF CUPS tarot card by A.E. Waite and P.C. Smith. These images represent both the happy uniting of two people in love, and their fatal entanglement.

On the left, the lips and the hairy chin of this head can be seen, which is reminiscent of a well-known portrait by Rembrandt. The unkempt hair on the chin and on the back of the head also point to certain characters from the story of The Golden Ass. All in all, this is a thoroughly ambiguous and complex picture.

        <br />This card is all about the quality of feelings. The nudity of the figures does not only represent beauty and naturalness. Symbolically, it encourages honesty and at the same time warns of insolence (shamelessness and lack of culture). The red forms in the upper corners can be interpreted as a curtain, but are also reminiscent of the jellyfish seen in the SIX OF CUpS or some phantom figures on other cards. To the left and right, two springs gush forth, representing the inconsistencies and disharmonies of one's emotional life.
        <br />Overall, this is a lucky and auspicious card, if interpreted as a symbol of emotional intelligence. Conscious emotions are fruitful emotions. The magic of feeling needs to be enhanced by the magic of thoughts, words, and deeds to allow your personal means of expression to come alive. Integrate your feelings to become one in body, mind, and spirit. This inner unity constitutes the basis of happy and lasting relationships.`,

Quite often, it is this refusal, the saying of the simple word "no," that has been missing from your life previously.

Here and now, we are confronted with desires and fears that may issue from times long past or pertain to events in times still to come.
        <br />The image of two cups still upright means that we can always choose which emotions and needs to accept and which to reject. A beautiful new way opens up. The challenge is to walk through the doorway and this involves crossing the threshold. We thereby encounter a shadowy self, psychologically speaking, a double, the alter ego (second self). This theme is represented by the shadowy figure on the right. The shadow is a symbol of the unlived parts of the self and for unconscious desires and tears.

        <br />The seven cups are fashioned after the Waite Tarot. Their contents are drawn rather sketchily, emphasizing their symbolic character. The seven cups represent the promising yet deterrent character of gifts and presents. The head evokes not only beauty but also vanity. The tower like castle represents might and greatness, but also arrogance and loneliness. Pearls and precious gems speak for themselves as objects of beauty but also point to a passion for grandeur. The next cup contains a laurel wreath symbolizing success or futility, a funeral wreath or the laurels of victory. The dragon stands for the forces of the underworld, which could devour you or bring you luck.
        <br />The serpent represents not only wisdom but also falseness and base instincts. The seventh cup is empty, hinting at new possibilities or chances missed.

It is said that "everything flows" but sometimes, the inner life has dried up, or overflowed and submerged all.

Don't force your feelings and inclinations to fit into a preconceived logic. You will find your own destiny in the balance of your own feelings and thoughts.

His lofty realm of the mind begins high above the mountaintops.

        <br />The bishop or man of the Church highlights the danger of entertaining false beliefs in a state of worldly innocence.

The peaks of knowing include the limits of our knowledge as well as the realm in which knowing is transformed into believing.
        <br />Heaven and earth represent mental absoluteness and practical necessity. He who knows much will also have to define his place between heaven and earth, between God and the world. Success or failure depend very much upon your ability to question yourself and to view yourself from the outside. The shadowy figure on the left indicates the positive ability to look at yourself from a neutral perspective with loving and, at the same time, critical eyes.

Besides their hard and metallic aspect, swords always have a lighter, elf-lke quality which on this card (and in many other tarot decks) is symbolized by the butterfly. What is highly unusual is the presentation of the key motif on a bowl or a dish. The knight appears to be more like a little tin soldier or a trophy to be put on a shelf.
        <br />But this is nevertheless a very wise depiction. Living a pure symbolic life is one of the greatest of dangers, but when acknowledged, a great task. If you live completely within and for the realm of the mind, you will be completely absorbed in your imagination, your ideas, and your perceptions. You might think the tile of a doctor or a professor, an award, or a medal will bring you the greatest happiness. To gather such trophies might become your most important goal in life. But because these trophies are nothing but symbols, your life becomes merely symbolic. In this rather chilling version of mental radicalism, you ultimately sacrifice your humanity for the sake of amassing trophies. This will lead to a shrivelling up of your personality, which then can be shown around on a silver platter.
        <br />Positive alternatives may vary, but they always have to do with overcoming the dangers of symbolic life and using the power of your mind to deal with real problems and to experience real happiness. In a positive sense, the pomp and the adornments of the horseman represent a colorful, rich, and liberated life-including a clear conscience (see the white color of the hat and the horse) and plenty of love (see the red color of the horse and its rider).`,

Not only an executioner's instrument of power, the sword was a means to form a judgment, like the scales. While the scales measure, the sword examines and discerns, being used to make deep cuts and draw the line, separating that which belongs from that which does not belong.

        <br />The realm of the mind is the air. The swallow and the angel remind us of the heights and depths of the world of the mind and of spirits. A single sword already expresses the ambiguity of the human mind.

To develop the former and avoid the latter, it is up to us to learn to fly.

Noble aims and ideals, represented by the moon, float overhead.

The card depicts a scene from the painting Roger Rescuing Angelica (1819), by Kon-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, framed by a big red heart. As ever, the message is ambiguous: perhaps a great abyss is opening up at the center of your heart— or maybe swords are about to free you from affliction and distress.
        <br />The picture is based on the classical motif of a battle with a dagon: a black serpent-like monster visible at the bottom of the hig heart. The image warns against hurt feelings - old wounds reopened by the sword. The positive message is that whatever problems we may encounter, the weapons of the mind and the eyes of love will enable us to find a solution, in a happy alliance of heart and sword.
        <br />Most problems arise out of a separation of abstract thoughts and your real feelings. Obsessive views and rigid ideas refuse to be checked against actual experience, paralyzing your mental and emotional faculties. Like a thorn in the side, they are a source of constant pain and irritation.
        <br />Give love a chance, including a love of truth and honesty. Shed light on your memories and expectations. Do not be afraid of painful truths. All wounds will heal if you tend to them.`,

        <br />This particular scene warns of the dangers of the hypnotic effects of ideas and of fanaticism in general, which turns people into martyrs and into politically or religiously motivated criminals. The serpent to the right is an ambiguous symbol. On the one hand, it tells you to beware of your base drives and animal instincts, on the other, it is a symbol of wisdom. Drawing on the four points of the compass, four swords represent the completeness of the weapons of the mind. Thoughts and ideas form a composite whole. Ideally, your thoughts should be "well-rounded." They should complement and inspire each other, as a sign of wisdom and expanded consciousness.
        <br />In less ideal circumstances, unmitigated thought manifests itself in disastrous convictions that can only lead to dire consequences. Then you will become a victim or a perpetrator, a fundamentalist or a martyr. There is not just a very real danger to life and limb - as in the case of Jean-Paul Marat. In a metaphorical sense, you are warned against human and spiritual bleakness, when convictions become more important than love or life.`,

        <br />Ferrying someone from one shore to the other can be likened to translating words from one language into another. Different people and their respective truths are like two shores or two different worlds, which need to be connected.

In many traditional stories, such as "The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs," the ferryman is condemned for all eternity to ferry back and forth. In his novel Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse created such an inspiring version of the ferryman that this archetype has become a symbol of the dignity of human consciousness as a bridge between two realms.
        <br />Whether or not we can cope with our current situation depends to a great extent on our mental clarity and openness. Useless thoughts are like old baggage, carried along to each new destination.

In a negative sense, swords as weapons of the mind represent its destructive power and, in turn, man's alienation from nature. The vicious and hurtful aspect of the sword culminates here in such a perfidious assassination. Aside from portraying an actual event that took place during the Ides of March, when Caesar fell by the dagger, the card has a more symbolic meaning. It tells us to beware of highly sophisticated and cultivated people who nevertheless succumb to their baser instincts and malice.
        <br />In a positive sense, the card has a quite different meaning: reaping the fruits of the mind. Ten swords represent the epitome of consciousness and knowledge. Breaking with traditional symbolism, this card does not depict a wise man, a philosopher-king, or a guru on a throne to represent the pinnacle of knowledge and insight. On the contrary: the TEN OF SWORDS heralds the end of all role models and idols.
        <br />For this reason, the old Zen saying "If you meet Buddha on the road, kill Buddha" has become associated with this card. This famous koan, one of the illogical riddles of the Zen Buddhists, does not intend to instigate murder and mayhem; it calls upon all of us to dispense with all role models and idols.

This is a blessing for the development of your personality, in spite all the difficulties involved.`,

        "longDesc": `Dalí, who has often been accused of godlessness and of being an enemy of the Church, uses the figure of Christ here to represent money and (new) values. For the devout: Christian, the picture of Christ represents an invitation to follow in his footsteps (imitatio Dei), to heed the call of God, and to realize your own personal calling. It is precisely this question of a calling that constitutes the traditional reading of this card. Although Dalí's picture is unique in Its composition, it conveys the same message as many other versions of this card.
        <br />The city or castle in the tree represents your personal goals, which are above and behind all your efforts. Do these objectives resemble a dream house or are they more like the proverbial castle in the sky? All your ideals and aims are being questioned now. You will not be able to achieve any peak performances if you do not call upon and use all your hidden energies, your latent talents." The circles on the robe of Christ or saintly figure may be interpreted as a labyrinth, probably hinting at the great effort and all the searching involved before you reach your personal summit. If you look at the labyrinth from a different angle, it resembles the shell of a great tortoise. This symbol encourages you to be consistent and patient, but to beware of reclusive and standoffish behavior. Only top-class achievements that enhance your personal well-being and expand your consciousness are of any lasting value.
        <br />Each person has his or her own peak to climb. Naturally, there are mountains of varying heights, but each has a summit. Your personal task is to reach your own zenith.`,

You complete the framework in which you choose to live your life, an environment in which your talents, your personal strengths and weaknesses will all find their proper place.

The black outlines together with the black areas around the figures and the rose and lotus flowers coalesce to form a lions or bear's head.

The answer: human community and individual uniqueness. The communal aspect is given special prominence in the left half of the card. In the right half, however, the figures are hidden by big flowers, which symbolize the flourishing of each individual's magic and the sheltering of private life.
        <br />Five coins represent the essence of the earth element: the full blossoming of your talents. This transformation is emphasized by the caterpillar in its cocoon (directly above the lower four coins) and the butterflies that have already emerged. It takes both community and individuality to succeed. Personal assets (property as well as ability) create enough value to rule out avoidable human hardships and make unavoidable distress bearable. There are hardships caused by hunger or sickness, but also others, which arise from unfulfilled needs: the hunger for meaning, the thirst for love, or the longing for roots. Each and every type of human plight is a tragedy. Where the need is greatest, our talents can achieve the most.
        <br />Make a virtue of necessity. Where the darkness is deepest, your light is needed most. Where your talents shine, walls become transparent and you will stand on firm ground in all situations. Take care of your strengths as well as your weaknesses and of big and small things alike. Build a bridge between heaven and earth. Become involved without becoming constrained.`,

Do not waste your time giving alms or appealing to someone's charity. Much more is needed here.
        <br />The figure on the right has a halo around his head, Again, Dalí can be credited with emphasizing the divine dimension (see THREE OF COINS, FOUR OF COINS, TEN OF WANDS). Whenever giving and taking become one, whenever strengths and weaknesses are reconciled, a divine blessing can be felt. This benediction is represented by the sketchily drawn figure with the raised arms in the background. Inside this hazy apparition, a red chalice or a glass with red wine and a tablet with eight rolls of dough can be seen. These items symbolize the Christian concept of transmutation: bread and wine provide physical as well as spiritual nourishment.
        <br />Whenever you use your talents to satisfy your needs and use your needs to stimulate your talents, there is always something to be gained. Both aspects will benefit by the result—a true win-win situation. In this manner, you can transform plain wants and banal necessities through blessed creative acts.`,

Objective facts and subjective questions are linked, and yet different.
