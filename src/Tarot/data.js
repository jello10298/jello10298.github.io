        "longDesc": `There is a kind of magic that really works and is not merely a matter of trickery, sleight of hand, hocus-pocus, or stage illusions. Magic, the "possibility of the impossible," is nothing more than becoming one with yourself, with God, and the world. The number of this card—one-can-not be divided by any other number in tarot. Significantly, the term "indivisible" has the same Latin root as "individual." We are all artists and magicians. On this card, Dali himself poses as a "magus," as THE MAGICIAN, displaying paraphernalia from some of his best-known works on the table. He thus draws attention to himself and yet we realize that each individual is being invited to take part-according to their own individual talents and qualities. On your personal journey, you go through unique experiences and come up with solutions that no one has ever arrived at previously, as if under a wonderful spell. But your personal magic is not really supernatural. It is merely a matter of success-fully fashioning your own unique existence by drawing on your special talents and qualities. The flames in the picture symbolize the life force, the fire of creation and transmutation lying dormant in each of us. The bread and wine (on the table) stand for the individuals participation in the divine act of creation. The "soft" clock represents the elasticity and uniqueness of your personal life-time, while the scroll on the table implies that you should take command of your own life by making plans and determining your own role. Like the columns in the composition, all aspects of your personality should complement each other and unite in serving a higher purpose. To this end, it is important to stay open (blue background), to go beyond your current limitations (just as the picture breaks through the upper frame), and to see your work within a larger context (taking into account the upper corners of the image).`,

THE EMPRESS has the face of Gala Dalf. Much has been written about the degree to which Gala dominated Dalf. But this card goes way beyond any biographical anecdotes. The expan-sive, open-ended background locates the central figure-taken from a picture by Delacroix-within a vast realm in front of a sea of possibilities. The imperial orb in her left hand symbolizes fertility as well as the globe, and thus represents the challenge to claim this vast land for oneself and to take command of it. The lily scepter in her right hand is an early symbol of fertility and virility. White stars dancing around the head of the figure ele-vate her above the blue water and the grayish mountains. This card is all about living a fruitful, flourishing, and star-studded life. Women as well as men are encouraged to become rulers of their own destiny and to take responsibility for their own well-being and fortune.`,

The message of THE EMPeROR should be heeded by both men and women, encouraging the art of self-rule and self-moti-vation. The lily scepter in the left hand of the figure is a symbol of might and virility, of the life force and fertility. Yet the color-ful figure in the foreground, in all its magnificence and vitality, is presented in sharp contrast to the pale desert and dark ruins in the background. The meaning? Our greatest talents will come to nothing, if they are used destructively or if we don't succeed in creating something new out of dereliction. The wasteland must be turned into a garden! Every one of us brings something original into the world, which is waiting to be explored and de-veloped. THE EMPEROR represents the pioneering spirit in us all and the ability to open up new possibilities in life or love.
Dali shares this interpretation with many other depictions of THE EMPEROR. What is different is the remarkable and unique position of the right hand. This gesture can evoke inde-cisiveness, or weakness. But by the same token, it may suggest a teasing and coquettish, even camp playfulness. The impact is underscored by the two little birds (symbols of spirit, Eros, will-power, and imagination).`,

The staff with the triple cross points to the Christian pope.
In a much broader sense, it is a symbol of a bond, of the interconnections between heaven and earth. 'The staff is like an an-tenna, which enables you to receive messages from near and far and transmit others.
The challenge is addressed to the whole person. The differ-ence in scale of the various figures is a metaphor for personal
strengths and weaknesses. Both should be utilized, stretching out beyond existing boundaries. The circles and rays around the figures head symbolize a higher consciousness, which tran-scends individual personality. For religious-minded people, this card refers to finding one's way to God and making peace with Him. In a broader sense, this card is all about teaching and learning, initiation and understanding. In order to know others, we have to know ourselves and thus become able to appreciate the purpose of our own existence.
What is so special about Dali's interpretation is that it fo-cuses on the mutual initiation and communication processes between people (or between different aspects of the personality).
Aside from the three figures, there is no church and no hint of religious dogma to be seen. But the halo around the head expands the dimensions at issue. Dali shows that the sacred manifests itself in our daily human interaction. Each person can be a spiritual teacher for every other person.`,

We long for love, but we may also be afraid to love and/or to be loved. Whether or not love makes us happy depends greatly on what hopes and expectations we hold about "love." As long as you are looking for your "better half," you risk being only half a person. Or we may be looking for someone who is most like ourselves. Ask yourself if this is what you are seeking.
For if you are looking for the one who resembles you in every respect, who knows and understands you intimately, that person can only be yourself.
The more pronounced the distinctions, the more precious the points of harmony. Once you have learned to love the dif-ferences, the doors to a new paradise will open. However, many shadows and dark clouds will create obstacles on your path.
Only love based on the individuality and originality of each partner will lead to this new paradise and be fulfilled (as in the image of the angel) in flights of inspiration and peak experi-ences going beyond the reach of each individual.`,

The land on the card represents familiar territory, and the water, the uncharted territories beyond. In order to judge wisely, you have to connect the known with the unknown— and learn to distinguish one from the other. The scales of justice mesure what is only vaguely known. Unclear feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations have to be evaluated, preju-dices have to be overcome.
Dali adapted the woman from one of Lucas Cranach the
Elder's famous paintings. Her wild mane represents an abun-dance of life force, but also the invincible spirit of JUSTICE. Her maidenly body encourages a reappraisal of virginity (a theme already addressed by the card THE HERMIT). Some people con-sider virginity and innocence to be lost forever with the first sexual encounter: Others regard these virtues as being goals of personal growth that we have to work towards. "Innocence is not something that can be lost, it is something to be gained"
(Bertolt Brecht). This kind of virginity and innocence is ex-emplified by mindfulness and the ability to get involved while avoiding entanglements and overidentification.`,

This card is all about evaluating the sum of your experiences and constantly reorganizing your life accordingly.
Every human being brings something original and novel into the world, represented by the embryo in the lantern, the homunculus. Above the head of the figure, we see jewels, some of them egg-shaped. Like the embryo, the egg is a symbol of fertility and of the growth of something new.
Your light gets stronger as you resolve your own contra-dictions. If you do not assume responsibility for your life or if you retreat into incompetence or irresponsibility, you will fail to approach the magnificent power of the HERMIT.

In 1494 he wrote his epochal work Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita, a summary of the entire mathematical knowledge of the time. One of the chapters made him especially famous, because it was the first comprehensive treatise on double-entry accounting. In Milan, he taught Leonardo da Vinci perspective and proportionality.

The picture shows the zodiac, reminding us of a ouija board. Outside the circle, five figures can be seen based on well-known depictions of the four evangelists and also representing the four elements earth, fire, air, and water. On top of the wheel, there is an Oriental man holding a scimitar.
The disc in the middle is divided into two parts, indicat-ing human consciousness and the unconcious mind. Both parts of the image complement each other, but differences are also apparent. The lower section is full of symbols and signs, while the upper areas are empty. This might suggest that the messages of the unconscious are conveyed through symbols alone.
The Greek word "symbol" in a general sense means, "that which has been thrown together," an appropriate concept for this card.

His essence is suspended in the heavenly; the transcendental, in a manner reminiscent of reli-gious images. At the same time, the picture could be interpreted as an underwater world, a land of dreams, or an otherworld, in which THE HANGED MAN is immersed.
Saint Francis's motto was "Metanoeite," which can be trans-lated as "Turn around and change." His symbol is St. Anthony's Cross. Saul turned into Paul. Stories about shamans, sorcerers like Merlin, or gods like Odin abound, who all had to undergo severe trials, during which each experienced a transformation.
On the other hand, the picture hints at inappropriate pas-sivity and at a person who simply "hangs on." THE HANGED MAN believes in the thing to which he is attached. And he is attached to what he believes. How tragic it would be if the belief turned out to be superstition.
So it is important to evaluate your own belief system, which may often involve turning everything upside down and com-pletely changing your own point of view.`,

The blooming rose reminds us that life and especially love are stronger than death. One can be dead while still alive. And one may live long after one has died. DEATH is not nothingness. It is the destroyer of illusions and of all that no longer fits into your life. It is a part of a process of metamorphosis.
The aim is for all of your desires and fears to be cleansed and clarified. Thus we become willing and ready again and serenely open.

The image is more like a sketch then a finished painting and it also seems to be less artful than the others. All these features have given rise to considerable spec-ulation. Rachel Pollack has called the picture a "crude comic"; others consider it to be a rather awkward homage to Dalt's lady friend Amanda Lear, while still others simply suspect that Dalt didn't know what to do with a card called TEMPERANCE.
In the upper left corner, we can see some letters painted over in blue, but these also fail to explain the true meaning of the card. Either it is just a blunder, a changeling among the 78 cards, or its meaning lies in a different realm altogether. Even in ancient Greece, long before the first tarot cards were created, temperance was considered to be one of the cardinal virtues.
It has to do with the right measure of all things and with basic human creativity.
We will not find our own true measure, our art, and our own style of living by looking up to idols and masters. What seems to be a foundling among Dal's tarot cards is really a provocation: the card urges us to become active as an artist and a master of the art of life in designing our own lives.
Traditionally, TEMPERANCE is considered to be a fire card.
Purification through fire sloughs off all dross, allowing true will to be reborn. This can only be recovered by giving up the position of commentator and spectator and becoming an active participant in life.`,

Although initially Gala could hardly tolerate her, Amanda became Dali's most important female friend.
Gala gradually changed her mind and, in the end, she wanted Amanda to take care of Dali after her death. Amanda was the model for Dalis painting Roger Rescuing Angelica (ca. 1970).`,

Two black arms release the figure or try to grab at it. This card appears strange at first glance, but it cleverly avoids a stereotypical portrayal of the Devil. So we are able to ask, "What meaning does the Devil have for us today?" Each and every human being brings some-thing new into the world, but we all have certain qualities and peculiarities that do not fit into the present framework. Every human being continues the story of creation —and therefore is bound eventually to enter the realm of taboo.
THE DEVIL card clearly indicates that some kind of taboo has been violated. What was implicit now becomes visible. This can be used to your advantage because you can now take on the task of openly dealing with taboos, affirming meaningful ones, and getting rid of others that are senseless.
Don't be put off by the bully. This is your chance to break some old horns. On the one hand, THE DEVIL represents a vampire and a real burden and vexation. No wonder we are afraid. Yet this is our opportunity to rid ourselves of the dark-ness that we have finally recognized for what it is.

        "longDesc": `Two archetypes determine the meaning of this card: the Tower of Babel and Pentecost.
The building of the Tower of Babel is a symbol of human meg-alomania, culminating not only in the destruction of the tower but also in the Babylonian confusion of tongues. Pentecost is the opposite of the building of the tower. The Holy Ghost descends upon the disciples in the form of a storm and tongues of fire. As they start to talk, everyone hears themselves speaking in their own language. Instead of a confusion of tongues, this event symbolizes the tearing down of all language barriers.
Babel and Pentecost are two opposite poles. Violence destroys and results in speechlessness and confusion. In contrast, love tears down all language barriers and makes true communication possible without limits.
The card cautions you to beware of megalomania and lack of steadfastness. There might be rocky times ahead. You are urged to leave your ivory tower and your personal objections and pretences behind when the time is ripe. This card also involves jumping out of the clouds and turning the free fall into flying.`,

        "longDesc": `Personal truth often seems to be like a distant star. It takes a long time to attain. But all our dreams are focused upon that star; our personal truth is the fount of all our dreams. This source will never dry up. You only have to find it and, as the figure on the card shows, take it into your own hands and raise it up high (hold in high esteem, cherish and venerate).
Once the star lightens up your day as well as your night, then the truth will be revealed in all its beauty.
Sometimes, the card warns you of inappropriate bra-zenness or compromise. The great blue serpent in the sky represents the wonders of creation that you yourself experi-ence. But the card also reminds you to be aware of the pitfalls of THE STAR, namely the "star cult." Be careful not to use your own light to put others in the shade. Be equally careful not to neglect your own light by becoming mesmerized by other distant stars.
Pitchers and chalices represent emotional needs, desires, and fears. In this sense, the figure holds her emotional needs in her hands. We carry the vessel that we are! An old idea claims that man as a whole is but a vessel in the hands of God—a receptacle that is filled and emptied out during the course of a lifetime. This vessel symbolizes the individual's part in the great stream of life.`,

There is a danger of getting too absorbed in our vacillating moods. Instead of putting ourselves in the picture, we hide in the big city jungle, howl at the moon like the dogs or wolves— seen at the bottom left of the card —or become petrified like the big towers. This is an opportunity for empathy to deepen. We feel at one with all living beings, as we are equally at home in the past, the present, and the future. This card conveys the promise of integrating that which has been formerly suppressed and transmuting the spiritual distress into the uplifting artful realms of the soul. The tedium of the everyday will be transformed into
real fulfillment.`,

        "longDesc": `The lion is a typical sun symbol while the Greco-Roman Apollo appears here as the god of light. Yet the card is rendered in darker tones: most versions of this card depict twins, mostly shown as children, which discreetly hints at the second birth! The second birth is a metaphor, which means that you as an adult have to be reborn, and moreover give birth to yourself this time around. Your first birth brought you into this world. Your "second birth" is nothing less than deliberately choosing your own life's path, no longer restricted by habitual behavior and fixed routines but informed by free choice and by exercising your own free will. Traditional behavior and thought patterns are replaced by a consciously chosen lifestyle. The "sec-ond birth" may be followed by a third, a fourth birth, and more, in a progressive path of renewal. But the "second birth" is deci-sive, as the first one to be undertaken deliberately.
This theme is common to the Buddhist goal of enlighten-ment or the Christian maxim "If you do not become like the little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
This second birth is possible only as the result of a process of becoming. As long as you are lacking a true understanding of yourself, you will remain in an in-between state, in a period of "being on the road" The subdued colors of the picture are in keeping with the tribulations on the way to the sun, the very center of yourself. This card is about finding your way towards the sun, which is located at the heart of the matter.`,

        "longDesc": `The image on the card is a traditional depiction of the Day of Judgment, some-what modified by the butterflies and the two faces in profile, An angel is sounding the trumpet, the graves are opening up, and the dead are being brought back to life. In the foreground, we see an open shell sketched in black ink, revealing its pearl. This detail represents the message of the card.
Powerful forces are being set in motion; latent energies are being awakened. Processes of change and transformation are immanent. This card challenges you to take a closer look at and come to terms with those extreme aspects of your life. Desires and fears, as well as the habit of putting the blame on yourself and others, will have to be dealt with over and again, until the mistakes of your past have been put to rights and your future path freed from old obstacles. Only then will rebirth be more than a mere repetition of the old.
The story of Judgment Day is not just a religious myth: it is to be taken literally. The Day of Judgment is today! Each and every morning we are faced with the task of becoming wide awake and gathering all of our energy, so that we can really bury all that is dead and gone and prepare ourselves for the birth of what is yet to come.
If we can accept every single day as a gift, we will gain in confidence and be able to welcome lifes challenges. Desires and fears will always exist, but we can learn to deal with them appro-priately. We will become receptive to the colorful spectacle that is life, which is inviting our participation.`,

Furthermore, THE WORLD also refers to the content of THE DEVIL card: the vampire or bogeyman and the prodigal son as symbols of the taboos that can be rediscovered in the big black being, which is imprisoned and seems to be weeping.
This card seems to convey the pessimistic message that evil always puts the righteous in chains and will eventually triumph.
But an alternative reading is possible: the Three Graces-and with them faith, love, and hope—will help the world to advance.
On long leashes, they pull up this dark and fiery creature from the depths of the earth to emerge at the surface. Humanity has not just descended from heaven to earth like angels, but is also a product of a long evolution. On every level of our develop-ment as humans, we are called upon to deal with our heritage.
Although we never cease to discover dangerous traits in our-selves and others, we also constantly discover new, hitherto un-known areas of growth.
In a positive sense, the ropes or chains represent our depen-dency on time and space. Our individual existence is bound to the existence of all others. We have inherited the earth from our parents and merely borrowed it from our children. We should not jeopardize this inheritance.`,

Seen from another angle, the zero point defines your personal starting point, the site of unity within yourself, at the very core of your being. Like the initial point of a coordinate system, this card represents the beginning of everything that makes up an individual.
To look into the future with courage implies charting your own course, not least when all role models have failed you and you are forced to act into the blue without any prior support. The more unusual your path, the more panic you will experience if you have to go down it. Pan in Greek means "all." Therefore, panic means "all-at-once." The more room you give THE FOOL in your life, the easier it will be to get used to accepting yourself, God, and the world as they are, as the supplicant saint in the picture demonstrates. In this way, everything you know takes on a special importance in your life— when the time is right.
Look at the shadowy figure by the wayside. It could represent your second self that you desperately need and long for. Do not take lightly the feeling that you are missing out on something. The fulfillment of these desires and the banishment of deep-seated fears are a priority. THE FOOL represents a state of unadulterated bliss.`,
